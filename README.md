---

## Requirements / prerequisites

Minimum software you should have installed on your development machine:

- Node.js (LTS recommended) — e.g., Node 18.x or later
- npm (comes with Node) or Yarn (optional)
- MongoDB server OR a MongoDB Atlas cluster
  - For transactions or some examples you must use a replica set (even locally via `mongod --replSet` or Docker Compose with replica set enabled)
- Git (to clone the repo)
- (Optional) Docker & Docker Compose — for local containerized MongoDB + app environment

Recommended:

- Recommended RAM/CPU depending on dataset size; for small demos 2GB is usually fine
- MongoDB Compass (GUI) or mongosh (shell) for inspecting data

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/PLP-MERN-Stack-Development/mongodb-data-layer-fundamentals-and-advanced-techniques-thomiyan.git
   cd mongodb-data-layer-fundamentals-and-advanced-techniques-thomiyan

2. Install dependencies:

   Using npm:
   npm install

   Or using Yarn:
   yarn install

Notes:
- If the repo contains a `package.json`, the exact dependencies and devDependencies will be installed.
- If the repo uses a monorepo or has multiple packages, check top-level README or package.json `workspaces` and follow repo-specific instructions.

---

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root (or copy `.env.example` if provided). Example variables commonly used:

.env (example)
```env
# MongoDB connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
# If using authentication:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/myapp?authSource=admin

# For MongoDB Atlas:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myapp?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Node environment
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

# App specific
SEED_DATA_PATH=./seeds/sample-data.json
```

Important notes:
- For transactions, you must connect to a replica set. For local development you can start a single-node replica set (see Troubleshooting).
- Keep credentials out of version control. Use environment variables or secret management.

Recommended MongoDB options (when launching mongod):
- enable journaling (default)
- use WiredTiger storage engine (default)
- configure `wiredTigerCacheSizeGB` if needed for dev machine memory constraints

---

## Running locally

Assuming Node + MongoDB are set up and `.env` contains a valid MONGODB_URI.

Start application:
- In production mode:
  npm start
- In development (with hot reload; if repo uses nodemon):
  npm run dev

If the repository provides specific scripts use those (e.g., `npm run server`, `npm run local`).

If using a separate frontend (MERN):
- Start backend (server) as above
- Start frontend (if present) with `npm run dev` inside the client directory (or follow instructions in client/README)

Connecting to MongoDB:
- Local server:
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
- Atlas:
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myapp?retryWrites=true&w=majority

---

## Using Docker (optional)

A simple docker-compose pattern (adjust to repo files) for local dev:

docker-compose.yml (example)
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:6.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    command: ["--replSet", "rs0"]
  app:
    build: .
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/myapp?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

After starting, if you enabled `--replSet` you must initiate the replica set:

1. Enter mongo shell:
   docker-compose exec mongo mongosh

2. Run:
   rs.initiate()

This will enable transactions for local development.

---

## Common npm scripts (conventional)

The repository may define these scripts. If not, adapt to available scripts in package.json.

- npm start — Start the app in production mode
- npm run dev — Start in development with nodemon / hot reload
- npm test — Run unit/integration tests
- npm run seed — Seed the database with sample data
- npm run migrate — Run database migrations (if present)
- npm run lint — Run linter
- npm run build — Build transpiled code (TypeScript / Babel) if required

---

## Database seed and sample data

If the repository includes seed scripts, run:

npm run seed

Common patterns:
- `scripts/seed.js` or `scripts/seed.ts` that reads JSON and inserts into collections
- Seed scripts should be idempotent or safe to re-run; read README in `seeds/` or view script source before running on production databases.

Example seed CLI:
node scripts/seed.js --uri "$MONGODB_URI" --file ./seeds/sample-data.json

---

## Testing

If tests exist:

- Run unit tests:
  npm test

- Run integration tests (may require test MongoDB):
  npm run test:integration

Tips:
- Use an in-memory MongoDB (mongodb-memory-server) for fast unit tests without an external DB
- Configure a CI pipeline to spin up MongoDB or use MongoDB Atlas free tier for integration tests

---

## Linting & formatting

If ESLint / Prettier are used:
- npm run lint
- npm run format

Follow repository's style rules to keep code consistent.

---

## Troubleshooting & common errors

- ECONNREFUSED / failed to connect:
  - Ensure MongoDB is running and MONGODB_URI is correct.
  - If using Docker, ensure `depends_on` and network settings allow the app to reach mongo.

- Transactions fail with "Transactions are not supported":
  - Transactions require a replica set. Start mongod with `--replSet` and run `rs.initiate()`.

- Authentication failed:
  - Check username/password, and `authSource` query param if user is created in `admin` DB.

- Slow queries:
  - Inspect query shape; add appropriate indexes; use projection to return only needed fields.
  - Use explain() and analyze index usage.

- Duplicate key errors:
  - Check unique index constraints and ensure client isn't re-inserting the same unique key.

---

## Production considerations

- Backups:
  - Use MongoDB Cloud Manager, Ops Manager, or `mongodump` / `mongorestore` for backups.
  - Test restore procedures regularly.

- Index management:
  - Create indexes before deploying high traffic changes.
  - Use `background` index builds (for older versions) or `createIndexes` in controlled maintenance windows.

- Monitoring:
  - Use MongoDB Cloud monitoring, Prometheus exporters, or MMS for metrics (latency, connections, page faults).

- Connection pooling:
  - Tune poolSize / maxPoolSize in driver options based on app concurrency and DB resources.

- Security:
  - Use TLS/SSL for connections.
  - Use least privilege users and role-based access.
  - Never store credentials in repo; use environment variables or secret managers.

---

## Performance tips & advanced techniques

- Favor projection and limit results to reduce network payload
- Use aggregation pipelines for server-side complex transformations
- Prefer bulkWrite for high-volume writes/updates
- Use partial/TTL indexes to manage churn and TTL expiration
- Consider schema design tradeoffs (embedding vs referencing) for query patterns
- For large data loads, use bulk insert and disable secondary building where possible

If you'd like, I can:
- Generate a ready-to-commit `README.md` tailored to the exact files and scripts in this repository (I will scan the repo and update commands to match actual script names).
- Add a `docker-compose.yml` or example seed script adapted to the project's structure.
Would you like me to inspect the repository and produce a tailored README that matches its package.json, scripts, and folder layout?
